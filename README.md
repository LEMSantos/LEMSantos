### Hey, I'am Lucas ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Computer Engineering at UNIVASF, fascinated by the areas of Data Science and Data Engineering, in addition to liking anything related to Artificial Intelligence. I aim to reach high positions in the area I like and travel all over the world. I try to be humorous and sometimes energetic, but I like to argue when it comes to R vs Python or how Artificial Intelligence is going to take over the world.
